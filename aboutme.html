    <h1>Creating My Path</h1>
    <p> I stood smiling on the stairs of the United States Capitol building right next to congressman Eric Swalwell, surrounded by my fellow 
        classmates. We were there in 2022 for our class trip to Washington D.C, and somehow I had family connections to the congressman to 
        set up a meet and greet with him and our class. I remember my classmates were impressed with my connections, and honestly, so was I.
        This was one of the memories of the D.C. trip that has stayed with me to this day, the trip where I had been across the country from
        my parents for the first time ever, the trip where I truly discovered what it meant to be independent.</p>

    <p> As a child, I had always slept at home along with my family. It was rare that I would sleep away. Whenever I had sleepovers, my friends
        would usually be coming over to my house rather than me going to theirs. Because of this situation, when the time came for me to go on
        the Gold Country trip with my fourth grade class to celebrate our last year in elementary school, I was ready to experience the change
        of being away from home without my parents for multiple days. I had always known that one day I would have to go out and make a life
        for myself away from my parents, so I expected the trip to be the first stepping stone leading me to that day. Gold Country was maybe a
        two hour drive from where I lived, so emotionally, I handled the trip very well. I remember thinking it was cool to be away from home
        with my friends and classmates for two whole nights. I got to choose when I went to sleep and what I did before bed. It was fun making
        my own decisions, being independent. By the last morning, however, I started to feel slightly homesick. Since we were only fourth graders
        without phones or other communication devices, the lack of outside contact boosted these feelings. I missed my parents and especially my
        siblings. My bond with both of my siblings has always been strong. I had been playing video games with my brother almost everyday, and
        I also had a good relationship with my sister. As the oldest sibling, it has always been important to me that I become someone that my
        siblings can look up to and possibly learn  from. Being without my parents and siblings for that trip made me realize that at the age
        of 10, I was not quite ready to go live on my own or be away from my family for long periods of time, but I still knew and wanted to be
        prepared for that coming day.</p>

    <p> Later down the line as a fourteen year old, it was time for me to go on another class trip, this time celebrating our last year of
        middle school. We were going to Washington D.C. to learn about our country and its history. Our first day was the most boring and
        longest of all. To start, I had to wake up at around three in the morning and be on a bus by four. My dad drove me to school where
        the bus would pick us up. There I had to say bye to him before getting on. He asked me if I was ready, to which I replied I was. I
        then turned around to get on the bus. Looking back, I don’t remember feeling much emotion in that moment other than excitement for
        what was to come. I was looking forward to the trip and sleeping in a hotel room with my friends. I was starting to think that when
        the day would come for me to develop my own path separate from my family, it wouldn’t be as hard to say goodbye. I knew that day was
        going to be different though. A five day trip was much more temporary than a college and career path. During the days of the trip, I
        was having a lot of fun with my friends both doing the class activities and hanging around in the hotel. My friends, being the funny
        people they are, could not sleep together for multiple nights without getting sick of each other, so we developed a rotation on who
        gets what bed on what night and who gets which bus seat for which ride. Together we visited museums, viewed monuments, rode past
        landmarks, ate at a bunch of fast food places, and got less sleep than we should have because we were goofing off into the night. I
        hadn’t felt as homesick as I did during the trip to Gold Country four years prior, but I admit that I did miss sleeping alone without
        my restless friends around me. When the last day of the trip arrived, I came to the realization that this would be one of the last
        memorable experiences I would have with a lot of my classmates. Most of us had grown up together, going to the same school since
        kindergarten. In two months, we would be graduating high school, and we would all be going on separate paths, either then or later.
        I realized that not only were they going to make a decision about which path they want to go on, but I was going to, too. I had to
        decide on if I would go to a private high school and pursue a specific kind of education, or if I would go on the route most people
        went on, which was going to public school. Ultimately, I decided to go public, a decision I am still happy with today. Arriving home
        from the trip, I felt I was one step closer to being prepared to leave the house and embark on a new journey.</p>

    <p> Part of the journey I would later have to start was creating a career for myself. Still a junior in high school, my career path is not
        set in stone, but I did put some thought into it before. A big part of making the choice of a career was to choose something that I
        was good at. As a student, my biggest strength has always been math and numbers, so that was an idea. Another part of the choice was
        making sure that the career is something enjoyable. While I was really good at math, I couldn’t imagine myself going to work and
        having to spend my whole day just doing that. I had to think of something that could combine math with something I really enjoyed.
        It wasn’t very difficult to think of what I liked to do, which was working with computers. Since the age of six, I had always been
        using computers, whether it be watching a video on YouTube, playing a video game, or doing an online homework assignment, all of
        which were activities that I really enjoyed, except for doing homework maybe, but I did prefer online assignments over pencil and
        paper ones. To this day, I still use computers for everything, and by far the most enjoyable activity I do is playing video games.
        This led me to the idea of game development. I was good at math, and I liked computers and video games. Adding those things together,
        game development made perfect sense. As a sophomore, I started watching videos on how some of my favorite video games had been made,
        and soon enough, I was able to get a basic understanding of how game development works. Not much time later, the time came for me to
        select my courses for my junior year in high school, one of the most important years in my high school career. My most important
        selections I decided on were Honors Precalculus, AP Statistics, and Computer Programming. These were all courses that would teach me
        skills I could apply to my pursuit in game development. Today, these are my top three most favorite classes this school year, and
        luckily, I have an A grade in all of them. Currently, a career in game development just seems right.</p>
    
    <p> Something pretty important to my pursuit of game development that I forgot to mention is that my dad works in the industry. After a
        long career in film animation, he started working at Epic Games, one of the biggest video game companies in the world currently. Ever
        since he had started working there, I had always developed a ton of interest for his projects from a player’s perspective and a
        behind the scenes perspective. Every few weeks, he would invite me over to his computer and show me the latest trailer or other
        project he had been working on, given he was allowed to. I had always asked technical questions about what he was showing me, and he
        would always be able to answer them professionally, knowing that I would understand a lot of what he was saying. Ever since a trip
        with him to the Oscars and seeing his name in the credits of movies, I have always looked up to my dad and have admired his work.
        He’s one of my biggest inspirations. Knowing someone in the industry of video games could help make my path to a career much easier,
        so I am very grateful for him and the fact that he is good at his job. I also know that nothing should be handed to me. If I want to
        get a job someday at his company, I’ll have to work for it and prove my worth. I can’t just expect to be given a job because people
        know my dad and what he can do. Also, the specific kind of work that he does is different from what I am interested in. His field is
        more focused on art, while I am more interested in the technical side of things. So while my dad is a great resource that could
        potentially help me get a career for myself, I know I’ll still have to make a name for myself on my own.</p>

    <p> Looking back and recollecting what I have learned so far in preparation for the day I have to leave home and build my own path, I
        realize that there is a long road ahead of me, filled with unknowns. I have had experiences being independent and living without
        my parents, but none of those can be fairly compared to leaving home for a whole college year. I have had experience with computers,
        math, and video games, but none of those will allow me to get a career in game development easily. I have a father who is inside the
        video game industry, but that doesn’t guarantee me a job alongside him. What I can appreciate about having all these things, though,
        is that I have dipped my feet into my future. I am at least a little more prepared for my journey in life ahead than I would be if I
        didn’t have these experiences and people, and for that I am grateful. I now know that nothing will ever fully prepare me for what
        life has ahead, but that is fine. My life up to this point has given me a general idea of what I want next and how to pursue it.
        However, there are still unforeseeable events and decisions that will come up later in my life, and the best thing I can do for
        those things right now is to not think about them, live in the moment, and be ready for what is next.</p>
